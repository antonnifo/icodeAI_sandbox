#### Dice Rolling Simulator 

When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6.
(Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.) 
The program will print what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again.  
#### Password checker 
The program checks the validity of password input by a given user. 
The following are the criteria for checking the password: 
```
At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
No white spaces 
``` 
#### Testing the scripts  
Tests are to be run with pytest or py.test on the root folder
